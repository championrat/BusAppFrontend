            <h2>Driver Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the driver guidelines page. As a driver, you are expected to follow the rules and guidelines set by our company to ensure the safety of passengers, other drivers, and yourself. Please read the following guidelines carefully.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guidelines-list">

                <li><strong>Respect the Speed Limits:</strong> Adhere to all posted speed limits and drive according to the road and weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong> Keep your bus clean and comfortable for passengers. Report any damage or maintenance needs immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Punctual:</strong> Arrive on time for your scheduled trips. Delays should be communicated promptly to the company or passengers when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Company Procedures:</strong> Abide by company policies related to bookings, passenger handling, and handling of bus incidents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Passenger Interaction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional Behavior:</strong> Maintain a polite and professional attitude at all times when interacting with passengers.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Assistance:</strong> Help passengers with their luggage, assist elderly or disabled passengers, and make their journey comfortable.</li>
                <li><strong>Handle Disruptive Passengers:</strong> If a passenger is disruptive or unruly, contact your supervisor or the authorities as per company policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bus Operation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Inspection:</strong> Before each trip, perform a pre-trip inspection of the bus to ensure it is in good working order. Report any issues to the maintenance team immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Make sure to refuel the bus when it is low on fuel. Follow company procedures for refueling and report any issues with fuel usage.</li>
